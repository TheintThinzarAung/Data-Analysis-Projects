## Folder Structure

- **`data/`**  
  Contains the raw dataset (`titanic.csv`).
- **`notebooks/`**  
  Jupyter Notebooks detailing the analysis, visualizations.
- **`README.md`**  
  Overview of the Titanic project (this file).

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values, corrected data types, and engineered new features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Investigated the relationships between passenger attributes and survival.
   - Created visualizations to understand data distributions and patterns.
