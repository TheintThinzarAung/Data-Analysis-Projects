## Folder Structure

- **`data/`**  
  Contains the raw dataset (`titanic.csv`).
- **`notebooks/`**  
  Jupyter Notebooks detailing the analysis, visualizations, and model-building steps.
- **`scripts/`**  
  Python scripts for data cleaning, feature engineering, and additional utilities.
- **`README.md`**

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values, corrected data types, and engineered new features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Investigated the relationships between passenger attributes and survival.
   - Created visualizations to understand data distributions and patterns.
3. **Model Building**  
   - Developed a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression) to predict survival.
   - Tuned hyperparameters and evaluated model performance.
4. **Results & Conclusions**  
   - Summarized findings and highlighted the most significant factors influencing survival.
