# Titanic Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the analysis of the Titanic dataset, aiming to predict passenger survival based on features such as age, sex, and class. The project demonstrates various data analysis techniques, from data cleaning to visualizations.

## Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset used for practicing data analysis and machine learning. The project is split into multiple sections to help understand the various aspects of data analysis.

## Folder Structure

- `data/` - Contains the dataset (`titanic.csv`).
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter Notebooks with detailed analysis and visualizations.
- `README.md` - Overview of the Titanic project.

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing relationships between features and survival.
